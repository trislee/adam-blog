This page contains various datasets I've generated that I think are worth sharing.

* [Iraq protest videos][iraq]: videos from tweets containing hashtags associated with the Iraqi protests in October 2019.

* [Fascist Forge forum][ff]: All comments, posts, and user data from the militant accelerationist neo-Nazi website Fascist Forge. See [this post][ff-post] for more details.
